🚀 FINAL BUILD COMPLETION INSTRUCTIONS
Copy and paste this into your Base44 editor chat:

text
Complete these final 4 fixes to finish the build:

1. ENFORCE 10-PRODUCT RULE: On StoreProfile page, free stores must display exactly the first 10 products with full prices and inventory visible. Add a 'Load More Products' button below the 10th product. When clicked, load remaining products in batches of 10. Premium stores show all products without this limit.

2. OPTIMIZE FOR iPHONE 16 PRO MAX: Fix StoreOwnerDashboard for 430x932px mobile viewport. Ensure responsive layout with no overflow issues, all admin panels render correctly, navigation works smoothly. Add mobile-first CSS breakpoints.

3. PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION: Add pagination to StoreProfile showing 12 products per page with prev/next buttons. Lazy load AdvancedAnalytics component and all chart components. Compress product images. Target under 3 second page load on mobile.

4. REPLACE ALL LOGOS WITH TRINIBUILD LOGO: Find and replace every instance of the default logo throughout the entire app with my uploaded TRINIBUILD logo (circular design with Trinidad map, wrench, checkmark, red accent). Update: Landing page header/footer, Home page, StoreProfile, StoreOwnerDashboard, CustomerDashboard, Admin pages, mobile nav, favicon. Set header height 48px mobile, 64px desktop.
🎯 WHAT'S ALREADY COMPLETED:
✅ Fixed all .toFixed() errors (10+ components)
✅ Fixed all .match() string errors
✅ Removed premium product blocking code
✅ Fixed BulkImportStores & StoreDataCleanup components

Type:
