## ✅ CACHE CLEARED - Server Restarted

I've cleared the Vite cache and restarted the dev server with a clean build.

### What I Did:
1. ✅ Stopped the old dev server
2. ✅ Deleted `.vite` cache folder
3. ✅ Deleted `dist` folder
4. ✅ Restarted dev server fresh

### Server is Running:
- **URL:** http://localhost:3000
- **Status:** Ready
- **Build:** Fresh (no cache)

### What to Do Now:

1. **Open a NEW browser window** (not a tab in existing window)
2. **Go to:** http://localhost:3000
3. **You should see:**
   - TriniBuild logo
   - "TriniBuild: For We, By We" headline
   - Two buttons: "I'm a Business" and "I'm a Shopper"
   - Navigation menu at top
   - Ecosystem section below

### If You Still See Admin Dashboard:

Please tell me EXACTLY what you see:
- What's the page title?
- What's the main heading text?
- What buttons/links do you see?
- Take a screenshot if possible

### Verify the Route:
- Homepage should be: `http://localhost:3000/` or `http://localhost:3000/#/`
- Admin should be: `http://localhost:3000/#/admin`

**Make sure you're going to the ROOT URL, not /admin!**
